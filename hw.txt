TDD:
- create a class called RoundedSizeRectangle
- define m_width, m_height as Integer (or int)
- in the ctor get 2 floats - RoundedSizeRectangle(float width, float height)
  in the ctor round the values, for RoundedSizeRectangle(5.8, 7.1)
  will set m_width to 6 and m_height to 7 (because they were rounded)
- write a test that creates an instance and checks using reflection if the values were correctly rounded
- define an EMPTY function called getArea which returns the area (return 0 at start)
- now write a TDD test which creates an instance and calls getArea (it should fail ofcourse)
- now implement the getArea function and run the test. it should pass

Web server:
- create a new spring project with tomcat web server
- create a controller called WordController
- create a function at route /counter which gets a string parameter and print the number of characters
  i.e. http://localhost:8080/counter?word=hello
  will return a page with the number 5:
  5
- create a function at route /concat which gets 2 string parameters and print them with underline
  i.e. http://localhost:8080/concat?word1=hello&word2=world
  will return a page with the text "hello world":
  hello world
